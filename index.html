          Substantive changes to the Payment Request API since the 9 July 2018
          version are as follows. The complete list of changes, including all

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added support for notification when the user selects a payment
          handler, but before confirming payment. This allows merchant to
          update totals, validate acceptance, etc.
          </li>
          <li>Added support to notify site of billing address selection. This
          allows a merchant to update a total (e.g., for VAT in Europe). To
          enhance privacy, only some billing address data is returned to the
          merchant as long as the user has not confirmed payment.
          </li>
          <li data-link-for="PaymentResponse">Added support for {{retry()}} and
          fine-grain error reporting to the user.
          </li>
          <li>Added support for merchant validation by the payment handler.
          </li>
          <li data-link-for="PaymentRequest">Clearer definition of
          <a>canMakePayment()</a> and worked to align implementations.
          <a>canMakePayment()</a> does not reveal whether payment handler is
          primed to pay.
          </li>
          <li>Removed `languageCode` and `regionCode` from {{PaymentAddress}}.
          </li>
          <li>Removed `currencySystem`.
          </li>
          <li>"<a>Payment request is showing</a>" boolean now attached to
          top-level browsing context. Previously, only a single payment UI was
          allowed to be shown at a time across the whole browser. This now
          allows multiple browser tabs to show a payment UI at the same time
          (for those payment handlers able to support it).
          </li>
          <li>Integrated with [[[feature-policy]]].

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification describes an API that allows <a>user agents</a>
        (e.g., browsers) to act as an intermediary between three parties in a
        transaction:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The payee: the merchant that runs an online store, or other party
        that requests to be paid.
        </li>
        <li>The payer: the party that makes a purchase at that online store,
        and who authenticates and authorizes payment as required.
        </li>
        <li>The <dfn>payment method</dfn>: the means that the payer uses to pay
        the payee (e.g., a basic card payment). The <dfn>payment method
        provider</dfn> establishes the ecosystem to support that payment
        method.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The details of how to fulfill a payment request for a given <a>payment
        method</a> is an implementation detail of a <dfn>payment handler</dfn>.
        Concretely, each payment handler defines:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <dfn>Steps to check if a payment can be made</dfn>:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          How a payment handler determines whether it, or the user, can
          potentially "make a payment" is also an implementation detail of a
          payment handler. For an example, see the <a data-cite=
          "?payment-method-basic-card#steps-to-check-if-a-payment-can-be-made">can
          make payment</a> algorithm of [[[?payment-method-basic-card]]].
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn>Steps to respond to a payment request</dfn>:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Steps that return an object or <a>dictionary</a> that a merchant uses
          to process or validate the transaction. The structure of this object
          is specific to each <a>payment method</a>. For an example of such an
          object, see the {{BasicCardResponse}} dictionary of
          [[[?payment-method-basic-card]]].
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn>Steps for when a user changes payment method</dfn> (optional)
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Steps that describe how to handle the user changing payment method
            or monetary instrument (e.g., from a debit card to a credit card)
            that results in a <a>dictionary</a> or {{object}} or null.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        This API also enables web sites to take advantage of more secure
        payment schemes (e.g., tokenization and system-level authentication)
        that are not possible with standard JavaScript libraries. This has the
        potential to reduce liability for the merchant and helps protect
        sensitive user information.

          Goals and scope
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow the user agent to act as intermediary between a merchant,
          user, and <a>payment method provider</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Enable user agents to streamline the user's payment experience by
          taking into account user preferences, merchant information, security
          considerations, and other factors.
          </li>
          <li>Standardize (to the extent that it makes sense) the communication
          flow between a merchant, user agent, and <a>payment method
          provider</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Enable a <a>payment method provider</a> to bring more secure

      <h2>
        Examples of usage
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to use the API, the developer needs to provide and keep track
        of a number of key pieces of information. These bits of information are
        passed to the {{PaymentRequest}} constructor as arguments, and
        subsequently used to update the payment request being displayed to the
        user. Namely, these bits of information are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The |methodData|: A sequence of <a>PaymentMethodData</a>s that
        represents the <a>payment methods</a> that the site supports (e.g., "we
        support card-based payments, but only Visa and MasterCard credit
        cards.").
        </li>
        <li>The |details|: The details of the transaction, as a
        <a>PaymentDetailsInit</a> dictionary. This includes total cost, and
        optionally a list of goods or services being purchased, for physical
        goods, and shipping options. Additionally, it can optionally include
        "modifiers" to how payments are made. For example, "if you pay with a
        card belonging to network X, it incurs a US$3.00 processing fee".
        </li>
        <li>The |options|: Optionally, a list of things as
        <a>PaymentOptions</a> that the site needs to deliver the good or
        service (e.g., for physical goods, the merchant will typically need a
        physical address to ship to. For digital goods, an email will usually
        suffice).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p data-link-for="PaymentRequest">
        Once a {{PaymentRequest}} is constructed, it's presented to the end
        user via the <a>show()</a> method. The <a>show()</a> returns a promise
        that, once the user confirms request for payment, results in a
        <a>PaymentResponse</a>.
      </p>

        <h3>
          Declaring multiple ways of paying
        </h3>
        <p>
          When constructing a new {{PaymentRequest}}, a merchant uses the first
          argument (|methodData|) to list the different ways a user can pay for
          things (e.g., credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.). More
          specifically, the |methodData| sequence contains
          <a>PaymentMethodData</a> dictionaries containing the <a>payment
          method identifiers</a> for the <a>payment methods</a> that the
          merchant accepts and any associated <a>payment method</a> specific
          data (e.g., which credit card networks are supported).

          second argument of the constructor (|details|) to provide the details
          of the transaction that the user is being asked to complete. This
          includes the total of the order and, optionally, some line items that

          shipped). To request this information, a merchant can pass a third
          optional argument (|options|) to the {{PaymentRequest}} constructor
          indicating what information they require. When the payment request is
          shown, the user agent will request this information from the end user

          A developer creates a {{PaymentRequest}} to make a payment request.
          This is typically associated with the user initiating a payment
          process (e.g., by activating a "Buy," "Purchase," or "Checkout"
          button on a web site, selecting a "Power Up" in an interactive game,
          or paying at a kiosk in a parking structure). The {{PaymentRequest}}
          allows developers to exchange information with the <a>user agent</a>
          while the user is providing input (up to the point of user approval
          or denial of the payment request).

          The <a>shippingAddress</a>, <a>shippingOption</a>, and

      <p class="Note">
        The <a>payment request is showing</a> boolean simply prevents more than

            The <a>show()</a> method is called when a developer wants to begin

            returns a {{Promise}} that will be resolved when the <a>user
            accepts the payment request</a>. Some kind of user interface will

            Each payment handler controls what happens when multiple browsing

        <div class="note">
          <p>
            The <a>abort()</a> method is called if a developer wishes to tell
            the <a>user agent</a> to abort the payment |request| and to tear
            down any user interface that might be shown. The <a>abort()</a> can
            only be called after the <a>show()</a> method has been called (see
            <a>states</a>) and before this instance's <a>[[\acceptPromise]]</a>
            has been resolved. For example, developers might choose to do this
            if the goods they are selling are only available for a limited
            amount of time. If the user does not accept the payment request
            within the allowed time period, then the request will be aborted.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <a>user agent</a> might not always be able to abort a request.
            For example, if the <a>user agent</a> has delegated responsibility
            for the request to another app. In this situation, <a>abort()</a>
            will reject the returned {{Promise}}.

            canonical form is upper case. However, the set of combinations of
            currency code for which localized currency symbols are available is
            implementation dependent. Where a localized currency symbol is not
            available, a user agent SHOULD use U+00A4 (Â¤) for formatting. User
            agents MAY format the display of the <a>currency</a> member to
            adhere to OS conventions (e.g., for localization purposes).

            <p>
              User agents implementing this specification enforce [[ISO4217]]'s
              3-letter codes format via ECMAScriptâs <a data-cite=
              "ecma-402#sec-iswellformedcurrencycode">isWellFormedCurrencyCode</a>
              abstract operation, which is invoked as part of the <a>check and
              canonicalize amount</a> algorithm. When a code does not adhere to
              the [[ISO4217]] defined format, a {{RangeError}} is thrown.
            </p>
            <p>
              Current implementations will therefore allow the use of
              well-formed currency codes that are not part of the official
              [[ISO4217]] list (e.g., XBT, XRP, etc.). If the provided code is
              a currency that the browser knows how to display, then an
              implementation will generally display the appropriate currency
              symbol in the user interface (e.g., "USD" is shown as "$", "GBP"
              is "Â£", and the non-standard "XBT" could be shown as "É"). When a
              code cannot be matched, the specification recommends browsers
              show a scarab "Â¤".
            </p>
            <p>
              Efforts are underway at ISO to account for digital currencies,
              which may result in an update to the [[ISO4217]] registry or an
              entirely new registry. The community expects this will resolve
              ambiguities that have crept in through the use of non-standard
              3-letter codes; for example, does "BTC" refer to Bitcoin or to a
              future Bhutan currency? At the time of publication, it remains
              unclear what form this evolution will take, or even the time
              frame in which the work will be completed. The W3C Web Payments
              Working Group is liaising with ISO so that, in the future,
              revisions to this specification remain compatible with relevant
              ISO registries.

            (e.g., "CA" for California). Unfortunately, the attribute was
            removed due to lack of implementations. The Web Payments Working

          Creating a `PaymentAddress` from user-provided input
        </h2>
        <p>
          The steps to <dfn data-export="">create a `PaymentAddress` from
          user-provided input</dfn> are given by the following algorithm. The
          algorithm takes a <a>list</a> |redactList|.
        </p>
        <div class="note" title=
        "Privacy of recipient information (the redactList)">
          <p>
            The |redactList| optionally gives user agents the possibility to
            limit the amount of personal information about the recipient that
            the API shares with the merchant.
          </p>
          <p>
            For merchants, the resulting {{PaymentAddress}} object provides
            enough information to, for example, calculate shipping costs, but,
            in most cases, not enough information to physically locate and
            uniquely identify the recipient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, even with the |redactList|, recipient anonymity
            cannot be assured. This is because in some countries postal codes
            are so fine-grained that they can uniquely identify a recipient.
          </p>
        </div>
        <ol data-link-for="AddressInit">

          |details|["<a>addressLine</a>"] to the result of splitting the

            <aside class="note">

                different or the same from that of the end user's. As such,

                costs. This varies across countries and regions, and so the

          The <a>complete()</a> method is called after the user has accepted
          the payment request and the <a>[[\acceptPromise]]</a> has been
          resolved. Calling the <a>complete()</a> method tells the <a>user
          agent</a> that the payment interaction is over (and SHOULD cause any
          remaining user interface to be closed).
        </p>
        <p>
          After the payment request has been accepted and the
          <a>PaymentResponse</a> returned to the caller, but before the caller
          calls <a>complete()</a>, the payment request user interface remains
          in a pending state. At this point the user interface SHOULD NOT offer
          a cancel command because acceptance of the payment request has been
          returned. However, if something goes wrong and the developer never
          calls <a>complete()</a> then the user interface is blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, implementations MAY impose a timeout for developers
          to call <a>complete()</a>. If the timeout expires then the
          implementation will behave as if <a>complete()</a> was called with no
          arguments.

        <p>
          It is common for merchants and other payees to delegate checkout and
          other e-commerce activities to payment service providers through an
          <a>iframe</a>. This API supports payee-authorized cross-origin
          iframes through [[HTML]]'s {{ HTMLIFrameElement.allowPaymentRequest
          }} attribute.
        </p>
        <p class="Note">
          <a>Payment handlers</a> have access to both the origin that hosts the
          <a>iframe</a> and the origin of the <a>iframe</a> content (where the
          {{PaymentRequest}} initiates).

          The {{PaymentRequest}} API does not directly support encryption of
          data fields. Individual <a>payment methods</a> may choose to include

          How user agents match payment handlers
        </h2>
        <p data-link-for="PaymentRequest">
          As part of <a>show()</a>, the user agent typically displays a list of
          matching <a>payment handlers</a> that satisfy the <a>payment
          methods</a> accepted by the merchant and other conditions. Matching
          can take into account <a>payment method</a> information provided as
          input to the API, information provided by the <a>payment method</a>
          owner, the <a>payment handlers</a> registered by the user, user
          preferences, and other considerations.
        </p>
        <p data-link-for="PaymentRequest">
          For security reasons, a user agent can limit matching (in
          <a>show()</a> and <a>canMakePayment()</a>) to <a>payment handlers</a>
          from the same <a data-cite="rfc6454#section-3.2">origin</a> as a URL

          Data usage
        </h2>
        <p>
          <a>Payment method</a> owners establish the privacy policies for how
          user data collected for the payment method may be used. Payment
          Request API sets a clear expectation that data will be used for the
          purposes of completing a transaction, and user experiences associated
          with this API convey that intention. It is the responsibility of the
          payee to ensure that any data usage conforms to payment method
          policies. For any permitted usage beyond completion of the
          transaction, the payee should clearly communicate that usage to the
          user.

          Exposing user information
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <a>user agent</a> MUST NOT share information about the user with
          a developer (e.g., the shipping address) without user consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>user agent</a> MUST NOT share the values of the
          {{PaymentDetailsBase/displayItems}} member or
          {{PaymentDetailsModifier/additionalDisplayItems}} member with a
          third-party <a>payment handler</a> without user consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The {{PaymentMethodChangeEvent}} enables the payee to update the
          displayed total based on information specific to a selected
          <a>payment method</a>. For example, the billing address associated
          with a selected <a>payment method</a> might affect the tax
          computation (e.g., VAT), and it is desirable that the user interface
          accurately display the total before the payer completes the
          transaction. At the same time, it is desirable to share as little
          information as possible prior to completion of the payment.
          Therefore, when a <a>payment method</a> defines the <a>steps for when
          a user changes payment method</a>, it is important to minimize the
          data shared via the {{PaymentMethodChangeEvent}}'s <a data-link-for=
          "PaymentMethodChangeEvent">methodDetails</a> attribute. Requirements
          and approaches for minimizing shared data are likely to vary by
          <a>payment method</a> and might include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use of a "|redactList|" for <a>physical addresses</a>. The
          current specification makes use of a "|redactList|" to redact the <a>
            address line</a>, <a>organization</a>, <a>phone number</a>, and
            <a>recipient</a> from a <a data-link-for=
            "PaymentRequest">shippingAddress</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Support for instructions from the payee identifying specific
          elements to exclude or include from the <a>payment method</a>
          response data (returned through <a>PaymentResponse</a>.|details|).
          The payee might provide these instructions via
          <a>PaymentMethodData</a>.|data|, enabling a <a>payment method</a>
          definition to evolve without requiring changes to the current API.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where sharing of privacy-sensitive information might not be obvious
          to users (e.g., when [=payment handler/payment method changed
          algorithm | changing payment methods =]), it is RECOMMENDED that user
          agents inform the user of exactly what information is being shared
          with a merchant.

          The <a>canMakePayment()</a> and <a>hasEnrolledInstrument()</a>
          methods have the potential to expose user information that could be
          abused for fingerprinting purposes. User agents are expected to
          protect the user from abuse of the method. For example, user agents
          can reduce user fingerprinting by:
        </p>
        <ul data-link-for="PaymentRequest">
          <li>Allowing the user to configure the user agent to turn off
          <a>canMakePayment()</a> and <a>hasEnrolledInstrument()</a>, which
          would return <a>a promise rejected with</a> a {{"NotAllowedError"}}
          {{DOMException}}.
          </li>
          <li>Rate-limiting the frequency of calls with different parameters.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For rate-limiting the user agent might look at repeated calls from:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the same effective top-level domain plus one (eTLD+1).
          </li>
          <li>the top-level browsing context. Alternatively, the user agent may
          block access to the API entirely for origins know to be bad actors.
          </li>
          <li>the origin of an <a>iframe</a> or popup window.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These rate-limiting techniques intend to increase the cost associated
          with repeated calls, whether it is the cost of managing multiple
          eTLDs or the user experience friction of opening multiple windows
          (tabs or pop-ups).

        For the user-facing aspects of Payment Request API, implementations
