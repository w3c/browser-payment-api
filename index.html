          The Payment Request architecture is designed to separate different concerns of 
          the Payment Request system into different specifications so that they can be 
          discussed and moved forward independently. This document describes the 
          architecture and explains what different specifications may be created and 
          how the relate to each other.

          The <a href="specs/paymentrequest.html">PaymentRequest API</a> requires that 
          merchants supply a list identifiers for supported payment methods. This 
          document defines those identifier strings and how they are created.

          This is a proposal for a new web API that will allow merchants (i.e. websites 
          selling physical or digital goods) to easily accept payments from multiple 
          payment methods with minimal integration.

          This specification is a <em>Payment Transaction Message Specification</em> used by the
          PaymentRequest API to support payment by payment cards such as credit or debit cards.
