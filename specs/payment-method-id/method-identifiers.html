        The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] requires that merchants supply a list
        of identifiers for supported payment methods. This document defines those identifier
        strings and how they are created.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues">a
        list of all bug reports that the group has not yet addressed</a>.
        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working
        group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.
        Pull requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues are strongly encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification was derived from a report published previously by the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          One of the principles of the PaymentRequest API is that merchants must know how to accept payments from the payment methods that they claim to support.
          This allows the API to abstract away the details of specific payment methods and to add new ones over time without changing the API specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the paymentRequest() call, the web page provides an array of strings that identify the supported payment methods. This document defines those strings.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Requirements for identifiers</h2>
      <p>There are a set of requirements that the payment method identifiers are designed to support:</p>
      <ol>
        <li id="req1">It must be possible for the Working Group to mint a payment method identifier for any payment method.</li>
        <li id="req2">It must be possible for anyone to mint a payment method identifier for a payment method under their control.</li>
        <li id="req3">It should be possible to use a standard short string to identify common payment methods.</li>
        <li id="req4">It must be possible for someone minting a non-standard identifier to make it globally unique in a cost-effective manner.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Payment Method Identifier</h2>
      <p>
        The <dfn>Payment Method Identifier</dfn> is a string that uniquely identifies a payment method that a user can use to complete a transaction. For example, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express are payment methods used in some countries.
      </p>
    </section>

    <div class="note">This document currently specifies multiple alternate options for payment method identifiers. The Working Group has
    not yet selected an approach. The chosen approach might be one documented in this specification or another as yet undocumented proposal.</div>

    <section>
      <h2>Option 1a</h2>
      <p>This section describes an approach to payment method identifiers using URLs.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Identifier format</h2>
        <p>Payment method identifiers are strings containing a <a>URL</a>. The string can be either an <a>absolute URL</a>
        or a <a>relative URL</a>.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Base URL</h2>
          <p>If the string is a <a>relative URL</a> then the <a>base URL</a> used by the <a>URL parser</a> is <em>https://www.example.com/to-be-determined/</em>.</p>
          <p class="ednote">
            The base URL needs to be determined and specified here. The base URL should be from a domain that the Working Group controls.
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Short identifiers</h2>
        <p>Since payment method identifiers can be relative URLs, simple short strings can be used as identifiers
        and they will be parsed using the base URL.</p>
        <p>For example, the string <code>visa</code> would be parsed into the URL
        <code>https://www.example.com/to-be-determined/visa</code>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Identifier equivalence</h2>
        <p>When the PaymentRequest API is invoked, the web page provides a list of identifiers for supported payment methods.
        The user agent must compare these identifiers to those available to the user and use this to filter what the user
        can select. To determine whether two identifiers match, perform the following test:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Let <em>A</em> be the first payment method identifier string and let <em>B</em> be the second payment method
          identifier string.</li>
          <li>Let <em>urlA</em> be the result from the <a>URL parser</a> when parsing <em>A</em> using the
          <a>base URL</a> specified above.</li>
          <li>Let <em>urlB</em> be the result from the <a>URL parser</a> when parsing <em>B</em> using the
          <a>base URL</a> specified above.</li>
          <li>The identifiers match if <em>urlA</em> <strong>equals</strong> <em>urlB</em> using the
          <a>URL equivalence</a> test (i.e. the test returns true).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Dependencies</h2>
        <p>This section relies on several other underlying specifications.</p>

          <dd>The terms <dfn>URL</dfn>, <dfn>absolute URL</dfn>, <dfn>base URL</dfn>, <dfn>relative URL</dfn>, <dfn>URL parser</dfn>, and <dfn>URL equivalence</dfn> are defined by [[!url-1-20141209]] <small><em>(or the editor's draft)</em></small>.</dd>

        <h2>Discussion topics</h2>
        <p>The following observations are made about this option:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This option satisfies <a href="#req1">requirement 1</a> because the Working Group can specify
            identifiers leading to URLs from domains that the Working Group controls.
          </li>
          <li>
            This option satisfies <a href="#req2">requirement 2</a> because anybody can specify
            identifiers leading to URLs from domains that they control.
          </li>
          <li>
            This option satisfies <a href="#req3">requirement 3</a> because the Working Group can specify
            common payment method identifiers as short string relative URLs. Since the Working Group
            is defining them, they can be relative to the Working Group defined base URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            This option satisfies <a href="#req4">requirement 4</a> because it is within your control to
            create URLs from domains that you control that are globally unique.
          </li>
          <li>
            Advantages:
            <ul>
              <li>URLs are familiar and easily understood.</li>
              <li>URLs can easily be created in a distributed fashion.</li>
              <li><p>The parsed URL could be used as part of a discoverable registration mechanism. For example,
                a manifest resource could be located at the URL: a user agent could download the manifest whenever
                a merchant supports a method that the user agent doesn't recognised.</p>
              <p>However, registration is a
              comparatively rare operation compared to making a payment. If a user agent downloads manifests
              every time a site calls the API this could result in a tremendous amount of traffic.</p><p>For example,
              if bobspay.com has a manifest file then lots of merchants might support this payment method. If there
              exist lots of users who never want to install the bobspay.com payment app but who visit sites that accept
              bobspay.com then there is going to be lots of traffic generated for the bobspay.com manifest.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Disadvantages:
            <ul>
              <li>URLs are difficult to remember and developers often need to find a reference to copy and paste them from.</li>
              <li>Developers may find it confusing to us a URL if it isn't intended to point to a resource.</li>
              <li>Overloading the same string to mean an identifier in some cases and a resource location in others is undesirable. The intent of a URL is to load or locate a resource and may only be done sometimes with this proposal. A URL might mistakenly be crafted
              as an identifier but later lead to attempts to load it that weren't anticipated (by potentially large numbers of users).</li>
              <li>Experience with XML namespaces suggests that optionally downloading resources from identifiers tends to encourage
              user agents to hard code common identifiers for performance reasons potentially leading to a closed or unbalanced
              system.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="issue" data-number="46" title="Should a payment app identifier (URL) or a payment method identifier (URL) resolve to a machine readable resource that describes it?">
          <p>There is an open issue about whether payment method identifiers should resolve to a resource if they are URLs.</p>
        </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Option 1b</h2>
      <p>
        This section describes a way of expressing payment method identifiers
        using machine-readable URLs that may be aliased to
        developer-friendly short identifiers.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Identifier format</h2>
        <p>
          Payment method identifiers are
          <a data-lt="absolute URL">absolute URLs</a> that may optionally be
          aliased using short identifiers. For example,
          <code>https://visa.com/payment-methods/VisaDebit</code> (URL) or
          <code>VisaDebit</code> (short identifier).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Short Identifier Registry</h2>
        <p>
          A mapping file establishing short identifiers to payment method
          identifier URLs can be found at
          <code>https://w3.org/registries/web-payments/v1</code>.
          To reduce the load on fetching this file, it is encouraged that
          applications hard code the mappings.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Any short identifier registry that is not re-parsed every time
          will require a message version identifier to be embedded in the
          messages that use the short identifiers. The assumption here is
          that there is some versioning mechanism that is used by payment
          messages such that the payment apps and merchants know how to
          process short identifiers.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          The format of the document located at the short identifier registry
          URL above still needs to be determined. Options include a plain
          JSON document or a JSON-LD document. The mappings would be as simple
          as: <code>"VisaDebit": "https://visa.com/payment-methods/VisaDebit"</code>.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          It is assumed that once the short identifier registry file is created,
          it is never updated. The Working Group may periodically release
          <code>v2</code>, <code>v3</code>, etc. registry files.

        <h2>Content at Payment Method Identifier URLs</h2>
        <p>
          Payment method identifier URLs that resolve to content:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>MUST be served over HTTPS,</li>
          <li>SHOULD support HTTP Content Negotiation,</li>
          <li>SHOULD provide a human-readable document that describes the
          payment method when <code>text/html</code> is requested, and</li>
          <li>SHOULD provide a machine-readable document that describes the
          payment method when <code>application/ld+json</code> is requested.

          <li>If <em>A</em> or <em>B</em> is listed in the Short Identifier
          Registry, replace the value with its corresponding
          <a>absolute URL</a>.</li>
          <li>Let <em>urlA</em> be the result from the <a>URL parser</a>
          when parsing <em>A</em>.</li>
          <li>Let <em>urlB</em> be the result from the <a>URL parser</a> when
          parsing <em>B</em>.</li>
          <li>The identifiers match if <em>urlA</em> <strong>equals</strong>
          <em>urlB</em> using the <a>URL equivalence</a> test
          (i.e. the test returns true).</li>

      <h2>Option 2</h2>
      <p>This section describes an approach to payment method identifiers using strings that might be reverse domain names.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Identifier format</h2>
        <p>Payment method identifiers are strings. The strings can contain any characters.</p>
        <p>Payment method identifiers that are not created by the Working Group MUST be <a>reverse domain name</a> strings
        with at least one U+002E FULL STOP character. They SHOULD be based on domain names controlled by the creator.</p>
        <p>It is RECOMMENDED that payment methods use simple lower-case ASCII identifier strings.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Short identifiers</h2>
        <p>Payment method identifiers that do not contain any U+002E FULL STOP characters MAY be created by the Working Group.
        These identifiers MAY be aliases for reverse domain name identifiers that do contain U+002E FULL STOP characters. If this is
        the case then implementations MUST process the identifier as if the reverse domain name form had been provided.</p>
        <p class="note">Any registration mechanism must allow a payment app to be registered with multiple aliases representing
        the same payment method identifier.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Identifier equivalence</h2>
        <p>Payment method identifier strings are compared using case-sensitive matching.</p>
        <p>If a short identifier containing no U+002E FULL STOP characters is an alias for a reverse domain name identifier then
        the reverse domain name identifier should be used in any comparison.</p>

      <h2>Issues</h2>

        <p>The following issues are tracking aspects of the payment method identifier specification:</p>

        <div class="issue" data-number="11" title="What is the format for payment method identifiers for distributed extensibility">
          <p>Should the format of the identifiers be URLs (e.g., http://example.com/paymentmethod) or reverse host name (e.g., com.example.paymentmethod) or some other extensible syntax?</p>
          <p>If the identifier is a URL, should there be a resource that can be fetched from the URL?</p>
          <p>Is there a need to describe the payment method at the URL or provide some other information?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="issue" data-number="10" title="Should well-known identifiers be used for ubiquitous payment methods">
          <p>Should there be well-known identifiers that are simple strings defined in the spec that don't conform to the distributed extensibility syntax that are used for common payment methods?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="issue" data-number="12" title="Write-up initial proposal for payment app registration spec">
          <p>A registration mechanism may exist to install the code for new payment methods into the user agent. This process
            would add support for a new payment method to the user agent. This mechanism should be defined in a separate specification.</p>
          <p>There is an initial <a href="https://github.com/WICG/paymentrequest/blob/gh-pages/docs/registration.md">outline making a proposal</a>.</p>
