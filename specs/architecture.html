      <p>The mission of the Web Payments Working Group is to make payments easier and more secure on the Web.</p>

      <p>The group is chartered to develop multiple specifications including
      a browser API, an HTTP API, and other supporting payments-related
      specifications.</p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues">a
        list of all bug reports that the group has not yet addressed</a>.
        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working
        group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.
        Pull requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues are strongly encouraged.
      </p>

      <p>
        This specification was derived from a report published
        previously by the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a> and
	       <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/wiki/A-Payments-Initiation-Architecture-for-the-Web">A Payments Initiation Architecture for the Web</a>
         developed within the Web Payments Working Group, and a <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/wpwg/2016/03/04/fpwd/">blog post</a>
         on the Working Group's work.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Components</h2>

      <p>
        The following are key components of the Payment Request Architecture. These
	      components would normally sit between
        the Payment Service Providers (PSPs) of the payer and
        payee. Different implementations of this architecture may result in components running on entirely
        different physical systems communicating over network boundaries or, in the other extreme, the same
        physical system assuming the role of a number of components with communication simply crossing
        process boundaries. For some payment schemes such as Bitcoin, the components communicate directly into the
        scheme's infrastructure.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Payment Apps</h2>

      	<p>A Payment App is software used to pay. Banks, merchants,
      	mobile operators, and anyone else who wants to will make
      	these available. User agents are also likely to act as basic
      	payment apps, storing some information on behalf of the
      	user, as they already do today with passwords. We expect
      	payment apps will increase security and privacy by giving
      	users more control over what they share over the
      	  network. Payment apps will distinguish themselves through
      	the features and services they provide beyond the standard
      	API, such as strong user authentication, loyalty program
      	integration, back-channel communications with the merchant
      	for fraud analytics, and so on. </p>

    	  <p>Payment apps should be able to run on desktops, mobile
    	  devices, televisions and other devices and operating
    	  systems. The execution environment for the Payment App is
    	  called the "Payment App Host." The Payment App Host may be
    	  tightly integrated with other components such as the
    	  Payment Mediator or may be one or more separate systems
    	  hosting individual Payment Apps or a combination of
    	  these.</p>

    	  <p>As part of facilitating payment, a Payment App may
    	  render a user interface and/or take advantage of one or
    	  more other IO channels for payer or third-party
    	  interaction (e.g., payment service provider). In some
    	  cases and where supported by a payment method, a Payment
    	  App may be able to facilitate a payment without immediate
    	  user interaction based on prior payer consent. (Example: A
    	  Web of Things scenario where the payer is a machine
    	  capable of executing payments in accordance with
    	  predefined rules and logic).</p>

      	<p>The composition of a Payment App will be platform and
      	deployment dependent and many aspects of how the Payment App
      	communicates with the host, interacts with the payer and
      	payee, and communicates with third-party services will be
      	determined by the implementer who provides the Payment App
      	Host, as an execution environment for the app, and the
      	Payment Mediator, that mediates all interactions between the
      	Payment App and other components.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
      	<h2>Payment Methods</h2>

      	<p>Each payment app will support one or more payment methods. A payment method is a system and set of rules for payments.  We are designing the API to support the broadest possible array of payment methods. When a merchant accepts a given payment method, the assumption is that the merchant will know how to process the data returned by the payment app for that payment method.</p>

      	<p>Each payment method is identified by a <a>Payment Method Identifier</a>.
      	   The payment mediator compares payment method identifiers to determine which
      	  payment methods to offer the user. Payment Method Identifiers will support distributed extensibility, meaning that there does
              not need to be a central machine-readable registry to discover or register <a>payment methods</a>.</p>

      	<p>The information required to use a Payment Method is called Payment Method Data. For a given payment method within a payment app, a user may have multiple instances of payment method data. Examples: a personal credit card (PAN, expiration data, CVV) and a business credit card, or multiple Bitcoin accounts.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
      	<h2>Payment Mediators</h2>


      	<p>The Payment Mediator fulfills a number of roles:</p>
      	<ul>
      	  <li>It helps determine which payer Payment Apps can be used to fulfill the payment request given the payee's accepted payment methods.</li>
      	  <li> It helps the payer choose one (typically with explicit interaction or prior consent).</li>
      	  <li> It passes payment request data to the payer's selected Payment App.</li>
      	</ul>

      	<p>We expect that user agents will primarily act as payment mediators in this architecture.</p>

      <h2>Glossary</h2>

      <div class="issue" data-number="43" title="Terminology across all Web Payments documents should be aligned">
        It has been suggested that all Web Payments specifications should use
        common terminology. There is a Web Payments Interest Group glossary that
        contains common terminology that could be integrated into this
        specification and automatically kept in sync via ReSpec's dynamic
        terminology import feature.

        <h2>Relationship to Previous Concepts</h2>

        <p>This architecture uses concepts like "payment app" because the Working Group has found it challenging to adopt the "digital wallet" metaphor for several reasons:</p>

        <ul>
        	<li>
        	  In the physical world it is not practical for users to have multiple wallets. On the Web this is
            possible and for there to be a copies of the same payment method data in more than one wallet.</li>
        	<li> In the physical world the process of deciding how to pay is not done by the wallet, it is done by
           the user. On the Web the process of selection can be facilitated by digital algorithms that are capable
            of processing complex data and relationships to assist the user in deciding how to pay.</li>
      	  <li>
      	    In the physical world a user selects a payment method data directly because this what is held in their
            wallet. On the Web the user is more likely to pick some abstraction of their payment method data that
            may itself represent multiple payment method instances.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There is not a one-to-one mapping from the previous concepts to the current ones, as the modeling is fundamentally different. Here is how previous and current concepts relate:</p>

      	<table border="1">
      	  <tr>
      	    <th>Current</th>
      	    <th>Previous</th>
      	    <th>Short definition</th>
      	  </tr>
      	  <tr>
      	    <td>Payment App</td>
      	    <td>Digital Wallet, Payment Instrument </td>
      	    <td>A piece of software to pay</td>
      	  </tr>
      	  <tr>
      	    <td>Payment Method</td>
      	    <td>Payment Scheme</td>
      	    <td>A system and set of rules for payments.</td>
      	  </tr>
      	  <tr>
      	    <td>Payment Mediator</td>
      	    <td>Digital Wallet, Payment Instrument</td>
      	    <td>A piece of software that coordinates messages between Web apps and Payment apps</td>
      	  </tr>
      	</table>
