      <p>The mission of the Web Payments Working Group is to make payments easier and more secure on the Web.</p>
  
      <p>The group is chartered to develop multiple technologies. The current document describes a set of
    	technologies &mdash;the Payment Request Architecture&mdash; that, together,
    	provide merchants with a consistent way to request payment information
    	from the user, aided by a user agent.</p>

      <p>The focus of the Payment Request Architecture is to provide
        an abstract interface between a web page and a <a>Payment
        App</a> to facilitate a payment transaction. This is expected
        to streamline checkout and help reduce shopping cart
        abandonment, as well as make it easier to use new payment methods on the Web. This document
      	does not describe a complete architecture for end-to-end payments on the Web.
      </p>

      <p>This document does not address the full set of deliverables of the Web Payments Working Group.</p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues">a
        list of all bug reports that the group has not yet addressed</a>.
        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working
        group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.
        Pull requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues are strongly encouraged.
      </p>

      <p>
        This specification was derived from a report published
        previously by the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a> and 
	       <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/wiki/A-Payments-Initiation-Architecture-for-the-Web">A Payments Initiation Architecture for the Web</a>

      <h2>Overview of Anticipated User Experience</h2>

      <p>This (imperfect) overview of the anticipated user experience will help explain the architecture:</p>

      <ul>
      	<li> At the end of shopping on a merchant site, the user pushes the “buy” button.</li>
      	<li>The merchant site calls the payment API with purchase amount, currency, accepted payment methods (e.g., Visa, Paypal, Bitcoin), and any custom data for those payment methods.</li>
      	<li>The user agent determines the intersection of merchant-accepted payment methods and user-registered payment methods. The merchant can (optionally) use the API to capture shipping information through the same user experience.</li>
      	<li>The user selects a payment app to pay, and carries out any app-supported activities as needed, such as authentication.</li>
      	<li>Assuming the payment is authorized, the payment app returns payment method-specific data through the user agent to the merchant site.</li>
      	<li>Depending on the payment method, this data will either enable the merchant to be paid, or signal that the merchant has already been paid.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Components</h2>

      <p>
        The following are key components of the Payment Request Architecture. These 
	      components would normally sit between
        the Payment Service Providers (PSPs) of the payer and
        payee. Different implementations of this architecture may result in components running on entirely
        different physical systems communicating over network boundaries or, in the other extreme, the same
        physical system assuming the role of a number of components with communication simply crossing
        process boundaries. For some payment schemes such as Bitcoin, the components communicate directly into the
        scheme's infrastructure.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Payment Apps</h2>
	
      	<p>A Payment App is software used to pay. Banks, merchants,
      	mobile operators, and anyone else who wants to will make
      	these available. User agents are also likely to act as basic
      	payment apps, storing some information on behalf of the
      	user, as they already do today with passwords. We expect
      	payment apps will increase security and privacy by giving
      	users more control over what they share over the
      	  network. Payment apps will distinguish themselves through
      	the features and services they provide beyond the standard
      	API, such as strong user authentication, loyalty program
      	integration, back-channel communications with the merchant
      	for fraud analytics, and so on. </p>

    	  <p>Payment apps should be able to run on desktops, mobile
    	  devices, televisions and other devices and operating
    	  systems. The execution environment for the Payment App is
    	  called the "Payment App Host." The Payment App Host may be
    	  tightly integrated with other components such as the
    	  Payment Mediator or may be one or more separate systems
    	  hosting individual Payment Apps or a combination of
    	  these.</p>

    	  <p>As part of facilitating payment, a Payment App may
    	  render a user interface and/or take advantage of one or
    	  more other IO channels for payer or third-party
    	  interaction (e.g., payment service provider). In some
    	  cases and where supported by a payment method, a Payment
    	  App may be able to facilitate a payment without immediate
    	  user interaction based on prior payer consent. (Example: A
    	  Web of Things scenario where the payer is a machine
    	  capable of executing payments in accordance with
    	  predefined rules and logic).</p>

      	<p>The composition of a Payment App will be platform and
      	deployment dependent and many aspects of how the Payment App
      	communicates with the host, interacts with the payer and
      	payee, and communicates with third-party services will be
      	determined by the implementer who provides the Payment App
      	Host, as an execution environment for the app, and the
      	Payment Mediator, that mediates all interactions between the
      	Payment App and other components.</p>

        <p class="issue" data-number="38" title="How are payment apps shared between different browser brands?">
        When a user registers a new payment instrument, how is that payment
        instrument shared between different browser brands? For example, if I
        register a Visa debit card issued by my bank in Google Chrome on my
        laptop, when I go to purchase something using my mobile phone, is
        that same debit card available to me via my Firefox web browser
        (assuming I've authenticated in some way with both browsers)?</p>
      </section>

      <section>
      	<h2>Payment Methods</h2>

      	<p>Each payment app will support one or more payment methods. A payment method is a system and set of rules for payments.  We are designing the API to support the broadest possible array of payment methods. When a merchant accepts a given payment method, the assumption is that the merchant will know how to process the data returned by the payment app for that payment method.</p>

      	<p>Each payment method is identified by a <a>Payment Method Identifier</a>.
      	   The payment mediator compares payment method identifiers to determine which
      	  payment methods to offer the user. Payment Method Identifiers will support distributed extensibility, meaning that there does
              not need to be a central machine-readable registry to discover or register <a>payment methods</a>.</p>

      	<p>The information required to use a Payment Method is called Payment Method Data. For a given payment method within a payment app, a user may have multiple instances of payment method data. Examples: a personal credit card (PAN, expiration data, CVV) and a business credit card, or multiple Bitcoin accounts.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
      	<h2>Payment Mediators</h2>


      	<p>The Payment Mediator fulfills a number of roles:</p>
      	<ul>
      	  <li>It helps determine which payer Payment Apps can be used to fulfill the payment request given the payee's accepted payment methods.</li>
      	  <li> It helps the payer choose one (typically with explicit interaction or prior consent).</li>
      	  <li> It passes payment request data to the payer's selected Payment App.</li>
      	</ul>

      	<p>We expect that user agents will primarily act as payment mediators in this architecture.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Specifications</h2>

      <p>The Payment Request Architecture organizes the above concepts into several component specifications
	      so that they can be discussed and moved forward independently. The
        <a href="#payment-method-identifiers">Payment Method Identifiers</a> specification is the only
        common dependency. The following diagram shows the references between different specifications that describe
        the Payment Request Architecture. The arrows show normative references pointing from the referring
        document to the referenced document.

      <section>
        <h2>Payment Method Identifiers</h2>
        <p>The Payment Method Identifiers [[METHOD-IDENTIFIERS]] specification defines the format of
          Payment Method Identifiers. </p>

	      <div class="issue" data-number="10" title="Should well-known identifiers be used for ubiquitous payment methods">
        If we choose to support well-known short strings for payment methods then we will need to
        determine where to define them. We may choose to define these well-known strings in a
        formal specification.
        </div>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Payment Request API</h2>
        <p>
        The Payment Request API [[PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] specification defines the API that makes a
        user agent the conduit for messages exchanged between web pages (or applications) and <a>payment apps</a>.
        The web page supplies a list of payment methods accepted by the merchant. The Payment Mediator
        matches those against payment methods supported by the user’s registered Payment Apps.
        </p>
        <p>
        One principle of the Payment Request system is that when a merchant web site declares
        that it accepts a given payment method then it must know how to process the resulting
	      response.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Payment Method Specifications</h2>
        <p>
        The Payment Request API specification has no intrinsic knowledge of the payment
        methods available. When a transaction is enacted by the user through the API a JSON object
        containing the relevant information necessary to process the transaction is returned. The
        format of this "message" is defined specifically for the <a>payment method</a> and might be private
        to that method.</p>

	      <p>We expect some message definitions to be shared amongst different
        <a>payment apps</a>. One example is the [[BASIC-CARD-PAYMENTS]], which defines a payment
	      method identifier, method-specific request data, and method-specific response data
	      for a basic card payment method. We expect this specification to be a model for other
	      payment method specifications.</p>

        <h2>Payment App  Registration Specifications</h2>
        <div class="issue" data-number="8" title="Payment app installation is platform-dependent">
          There is an open question within the working group about what registration scenarios
          should be supported by specifications from the group. See the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/paymentrequest/blob/gh-pages/docs/registration.md">Payment App Registration</a> explainer and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/wiki/RegistrationTypes">registration scenarios</a>.

      <section>
        <h2>Relationship to Previous Concepts</h2>

        <p>This architecture uses concepts like "payment app" because the Working Group has found it challenging to adopt the "digital wallet" metaphor for several reasons:</p>

        <ul>
        	<li>
        	  In the physical world it is not practical for users to have multiple wallets. On the Web this is
            possible and for there to be copies of the same payment method data in more than one wallet.</li>
        	<li> In the physical world the process of deciding how to pay is not done by the wallet, it is done by
           the user. On the Web the process of selection can be facilitated by digital algorithms that are capable
            of processing complex data and relationships to assist the user in deciding how to pay.</li>
      	  <li>
      	    In the physical world a user selects a payment method data directly because this what is held in their
            wallet. On the Web the user is more likely to pick some abstraction of their payment method data that
            may itself represent multiple payment method instances.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There is not a one-to-one mapping from the previous concepts to the current ones, as the modeling is fundamentally different. Here is how previous and current concepts relate:</p>
