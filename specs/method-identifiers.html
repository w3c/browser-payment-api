        The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] requires that merchants supply a list
        identifiers for supported payment methods. This document defines those identifier
        strings and how they are created.

      <p>
        The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues">a
        list of all bug reports that the group has not yet addressed</a>.
        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working
        group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.
        Pull requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues are strongly encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification was derived from a report published previously by the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a>.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          One of the principles of the PaymentRequest API is that merchants must know how to accept payments from the payment methods that they claim to support.
          This allows the API to abstract away the details of specific payment methods and to add new ones over time without changing the API specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the paymentRequest() call, the web page provides an array of strings that identify the supported payment methods. This document defines those strings.

      <h2>Issues</h2>

        <div class="issue" data-number="11" title="What is the format for payment method identifiers for distributed extensibility">
          <p>Should the format of the identifiers be URLs (e.g. http://example.com/paymentmethod) or reverse host name (e.g. com.example.paymentmethod) or some other extensible syntax?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="issue" data-number="10" title="Should well-known identifiers be used for ubiquitous payment methods">
          <p>Should there be well-known identifiers that are simple strings defined in the spec that don't conform to the distributed extensbility syntax that are used for common payment methods?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="issue" data-number="12" title="Write-up initial proposal for payment app registration spec">
          <p>A registration mechanism may exist to install the code for new payment methods into the user agent. This process
            would add support for a new payment method to the user agent. This mechanism should be defined in a separate specification.</p>
          <p>There is an initial <a href="https://github.com/WICG/paymentrequest/blob/gh-pages/docs/registration.md">outline making a proposal</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="issue" data-number="11" title="What is the format for payment method identifiers for distributed extensibility">
          <p>If the identifier is a URL, should there be a resource that can be fetched from the URL</p>
          <p>Is there a need to describe the payment method at the URL or provide some other information?</p>
        </div>

      <h2>Payment Method Identifier</h2>
      <p>
        The <dfn>Payment Method Identifier</dfn> is a string that uniquely identifies a payment method that a user can use to complete a transaction. For example, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express are payment methods used in some countries.
