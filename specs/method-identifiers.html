        The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] requires that merchants supply a list
        identifiers for supported payment methods. This document defines those identifier
        strings and how they are created.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues">a
        list of all bug reports that the group has not yet addressed</a>.
        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working
        group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.
        Pull requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues are strongly encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification was derived from a report published previously by the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          One of the principles of the PaymentRequest API is that merchants must know how to accept payments from the payment methods that they claim to support.
          This allows the API to abstract away the details of specific payment methods and to add new ones over time without changing the API specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the paymentRequest() call, the web page provides an array of strings that identify the supported payment methods. This document defines those strings.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Requirements for identifiers</h2>
      <p>There are a set of requirements that the payment method identifiers are designed to support:</p>
      <ol>
        <li id="req1">It must be possible for the Working Group to mint a payment method identifier for any payment method.</li>
        <li id="req2">It must be possible for the anyone to mint a payment method identifier for a payment method under their control.</li>
        <li id="req3">It should be possible to use a standard short string to identify common payment methods.</li>
        <li id="req4">It must be possible for someone minting a non-standard identifier to make it globally unique in a cost-effective manner.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Payment Method Identifier</h2>
      <p>
        The <dfn>Payment Method Identifier</dfn> is a string that uniquely identifies a payment method that a user can use to complete a transaction. For example, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express are payment methods used in some countries.
      </p>
    </section>    

    <div class="note">This document currently specifies multiple alternate options for payment method identifiers. The Working Group has
    not yet selected an approach, which might be one documented in this specification or another as yet undocumented proposal.</div> 

    <section>
      <h2>Option 1</h2>
      <p>This section describes an approach to payment method identifiers using URLs.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Identifier format</h2>
        <p>Payment method identifiers are strings containing a <a>URL</a>. The string can be either an <a>absolute URL</a>
        or a <a>relative URL</a>.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Base URL</h2>
          <p>If the string is a <a>relative URL</a> then the <a>base URL</a> used by the <a>URL parser</a> is <em>https://www.example.com/to-be-determined/</em>.</p>
          <p class="ednote">
            The base URL needs to be determined and specified here. The base URL should be from a domain that the Working Group controls.
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Short identifiers</h2>
        <p>Since payment method identifiers can be relative URLs, simple short strings can be used as identifiers
        and they will be parsed using the base URL.</p>
        <p>For example, the string <code>visa</code> would be parsed into the URL
        <code>https://www.example.com/to-be-determined/visa</code>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Identifier equivalence</h2>
        <p>When the PaymentRequest API is invoked, the web page provides a list of identifiers for supported payment methods.
        The user agent must compare these identifiers to those available to the user and use this to filter what the user
        can select. To determine whether two identifiers match, perform the following test:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Let <em>A</em> be the first payment method identifier string and let <em>B</em> be the second payment method
          identifier string.</li>
          <li>Let <em>urlA</em> be the result from the <a>URL parser</a> when parsing <em>A</em> using the
          <a>base URL</a> specified above.</li>
          <li>Let <em>urlB</em> be the result from the <a>URL parser</a> when parsing <em>B</em> using the
          <a>base URL</a> specified above.</li>
          <li>The identifiers match if <em>urlA</em> <strong>equals</strong> <em>urlB</em> using the
          <a>URL equivalence</a> test (i.e. the test returns true).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Dependencies</h2>
        <p>This section relies on several other underlying specifications.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>URL</dt>
          <dd>The terms <dfn>URL</dfn>, <dfn>absolute URL</dfn>, <dfn>base URL</dfn>, <dfn>relative URL</dfn>, <dfn>URL parser</dfn>, and <dfn>URL equivalence</dfn> are defined by [[!url-1-20141209]] <small><em>(or the editor's draft)</em></small>.</dd>
        </dl>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Discussion topics</h2>
        <p>The following observations are made about this option:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This option satisfies <a href="#req1">requirement 1</a> because the Working Group can specify
            identifiers leading to URLs from domains that the Working Group controls.
          </li>
          <li>
            This option satisfies <a href="#req2">requirement 2</a> because anybody can specify
            identifiers leading to URLs from domains that they control.
          </li>
          <li>
            This option satisfies <a href="#req3">requirement 3</a> because the Working Group can specify
            common payment method identifiers as short string relative URLs. Since the Working Group
            is defining them, they can be relative to the Working Group defined base URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            This option satisfies <a href="#req4">requirement 4</a> because it is within your control to
            create URLs from domains that you control that are globally unique.
          </li>
          <li>
            Advantages:
            <ul>
              <li>URLs are familiar and easily understood.</li>
              <li>URLs can easily be created in a distributed fashion.</li>
              <li><p>The parsed URL could be used as part of a discoverable registration mechanism. For example,
                a manifest resource could be located at the URL: a user agent could download the manifest whenever
                a merchant supports a method that the user agent doesn't recognised.</p>
              <p>However, registration is a
              comparatively rare operation compared to making a payment. If a user agent downloads manifests
              every time a site calls the API this could result in a tremendous amount of traffic.</p><p>For example,
              if bobspay.com has a manifest file then lots of merchants might support this payment method. If there
              exist lots of users who never want to install the bobspay.com payment app but who visit sites that accept
              bobspay.com then there is going to be lots of traffic generated for the bobspay.com manifest.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Disadvantages:
            <ul>
              <li>URLs are difficult to remember and developers often need to find a reference to copy and paste them from.</li>
              <li>Developers may find it confusing to us a URL if it isn't intended to point to a resource.</li>
              <li>Overloading the same string to mean an identifier in some cases and a resource location in others is undesirable. The intent of a URL is to load or locate a resource and may only be done sometimes with this proposal. A URL might mistakenly be crafted
              as an identifier but later lead to attempts to load it that weren't anticipated (by potentially large numbers of users).</li>
              <li>Experience with XML namespaces suggests that optional downloading resources from identifiers tends to encourage
              user agents to hard code common identifiers for performance reasons potentially leading to a closed or unbalanced
              system.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

          <p>There is an open issue about whether payment method identifiers should resolve to a resource if they are URLs.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Option 2</h2>
      <p>This section describes an approach to payment method identifiers using strings that might be reverse domain names.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Identifier format</h2>
        <p>Payment method identifiers are strings. The strings can contain any characters.</p>
        <p>Payment method identifiers that are not created by the Working Group MUST be <a>reverse domain name</a> strings
        with at least one U+002E FULL STOP character. They SHOULD be based on domain names controlled by the creator.</p>
        <p>It is RECOMMENDED that payment methods use simple lower-case ASCII identifier strings.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Short identifiers</h2>
        <p>Payment method identifiers that do not contain any U+002E FULL STOP characters MAY be created by the Working Group.
        These identifiers MAY be aliases for reverse domain name identifiers that do contain U+002E FULL STOP characters. If this is
        the case then implementations MUST process the identifier as if the reverse domain name form had been provided.</p>
        <p class="note">Any registration mechanism must allow a payment app to be registered with multiple aliases representing
        the same payment method identifier.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Identifier equivalence</h2>
        <p>Payment method identifier strings are compared using case-sensitive matching.</p>
        <p>If a short identifier containing no U+002E FULL STOP characters is an alias for a reverse domain name identifier then
        the reverse domain name identifier should be used in any comparison.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Dependencies</h2>
        <p>A <dfn>reverse domain name</dfn> is defined by [[REVERSEDOMAINS]]. For example, <code>com.example.somemethod</code>.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Discussion topics</h2>
        <p>The following observations are made about this option:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This option satisfies <a href="#req1">requirement 1</a> because the Working Group can specify
            identifiers from reverse domains that the Working Group controls.

          <li>
            This option satisfies <a href="#req4">requirement 4</a> because it is within your control to
            create identifiers from domains that you control that are globally unique.
          </li>
          <li>
            Advantages:
            <ul>
              <li>Identifiers are relatively short strings even in the reverse domain case.</li>
              <li>It is straightforward to create new identifiers from a domain you control and
              there is no ambiguity about its use or purpose.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Disadvantages:
            <ul>
              <li>There is no way to automatically dereference a payment method identifier from this
              option to a resource located at a URL.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

      <h2>Issues</h2>
