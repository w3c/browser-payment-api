        This specification describes a web API to allow merchants (i.e. web sites selling
        physical or digital goods) to easily accept payments from different payment methods with
        minimal integration. User agents (e.g., browsers) will facilitate the payment flow between
        merchant and user.

        The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues">a
        list of all bug reports that the group has not yet addressed</a>.
        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working
        group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.
        Pull requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues are strongly encouraged.

        This specification was derived from a report published previously by the

    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Buying things on the
        web, particularly on mobile, can be a frustrating experience for users. Every web site has its own flow
        and its own validation rules, and most require users to manually type in the same set of information
        over and over again. Likewise, it is difficult and time consuming for developers to create good
        checkout flows that support various payment schemes.</p>

        <p>This specification describes an API that allows <a>user agents</a> (e.g., browsers) to act
        as an intermediary between the three key parties in every transaction: the merchant (e.g., an
        online web store), the buyer (e.g., the user buying from the online web store), and the
        <a>Payment Method</a> (e.g., credit card). Information necessary to process and confirm a
        transaction is passed between the <a>Payment Method</a> and the merchant via the <a>user agent</a>
        with the buyer confirming and authorizing as necessary across the flow.</p>

        <p>In addition to better, more consistent user experiences, this also enables web sites to take
        advantage of more secure payment schemes (e.g., tokenization and system-level authentication)
        that are not possible with standard JavaScript libraries. This has the potential to reduce
        liability for the merchant and helps protect sensitive user information.</p>

        <p>The API described in this document forms part of the Payment Request system described in
        the Payment Request Architecture [[PAYMENT-ARCH]] document.</p>

        };
      </pre>

      <p>
        A web page creates a <a><code>PaymentRequest</code></a> to make a payment request. This is
        typically associated with the user initiating a payment process 
        (e.g., selecting a "Power Up" in an interactive game, pulling up to an automated kiosk in a parking structure,
        or activating a "Buy", "Purchase", or "Checkout" button).
        The <a><code>PaymentRequest</code></a> allows the web page to exchange information with the
        <a>user agent</a> while the user is providing input before approving or denying a payment request.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        The <code>[SecureContext]</code> <a>extended attribute</a> means that the <a><code>PaymentRequest</code></a>
        is only exposed within a <a>secure context</a> and won't be accessible elsewhere.
      </p>

      <p>The following example shows how to construct a <a><code>PaymentRequest</code></a> and begin the
      user interaction:</p>

      <pre class="example highlight">
        var payment = new PaymentRequest(methodData, details, options);
        payment.addEventListener("shippingaddresschange", function (changeEvent) {
            // Process shipping address change
        });

        payment.show().then(function(paymentResponse) {
          // Process paymentResponse
          // paymentResponse.methodName contains the selected payment method
          // paymentResponse.details contains a payment method specific response
          paymentResponse.complete("success");
        }).catch(function(err) {
          console.error("Uh oh, something bad happened", err.message);
        });

          It is proposed that a conformance criteria for implementations of this API be 
          that any data passed into the request is passed on to the payment app unaltered. 
          This would allow extensions of the data schema such as the addition of 
          properties that are not documented in this specification or known to implementors 
          such as JSON-LD @context or similar to be passed between the website and 
          payment app.

          The <a><code>PaymentRequest</code></a> interface allows a web page to call <code>abort</code>
          to tell the <a>user agent</a> to abort the payment request and to tear down any user interface that

          only available for a limited amount of time. If the user does not accept the payment request
          within the allowed time period, then the request will be aborted.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <a>user agent</a> might not always be able to abort a request. For example, if the <a>user agent</a>
          has delegated responsibility for the request to another app. To support this situation,
          the <a>user agent</a> must run the <dfn>User agent delegates payment request algorithm</dfn>.
          The algorithm MUST run the following steps:

            If the <em>request</em>@[[\updating]] is <em>true</em>, then terminate this
            algorithm and take no further action. The <a>user agent</a> user interface should ensure
            that this never occurs.
          </li>

            that this never occurs.
          </li>
          <li>

          The architecture document suggests that payment apps may take
          numerous forms, including as web-based apps. This specification
          should describe how the user-agent will pass the payment request
          data and the complete signal to a web-based payment app and also how
          it will receive the payment response from the payment app.

        <div class="issue" data-number="7" title="Should we support a delegated state for PaymentRequest?">
          <p>We believe there are <a>user agent</a> configurations that can cause the UI to get into a state
          where cancellation by the web page during user interaction is difficult. Users should still
          be able to cancel the payment but script will not be able to. We need to investigate in more
          detail the consequences of this and whether it is really needed.</p>
          <p>If we specify <code>delegated</code> then it isn't necessary for all <a>user agents</a> to be
          able to move to this state but it would be necessary for all payment flows that wish to call
